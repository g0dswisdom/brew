# Brew (Based Roblox Endpoint Wrapper)
This is basically just a simple Roblox API wrapper created in Node.JS created to make sending requests to the Roblox API easier.

Development will take a bit

I was gonna release a big update but I fucked up my system and lost it. I'll probably update it in a few days though
